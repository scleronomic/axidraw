### goals
- easy and fast use
  - all file formats
  - all paper formats
    - centering, flipping, ...
  - gui to make adjustments
  - allow for pen changes
  - start again from break point
  
- understand the math behind the patterns:
- (nearly) optimal planner for the drawing sequences 
  - use the fact that drawing takes minutes - hours for complex pictures optimize the later paths while drawing the first lines
  
### todos
- all of the above
- +look at [https://github.com/nornagon/saxi](https://github.com/nornagon/saxi) and think about web based user interface
- add a gallery to show each picture
